# Fan controlled by temperature

## Overview

The project consists of a fan attached to a DC motor. 
The temperature and humidity senzor will send data to the program.
The program can be called with 2 command line arguments representing the option (temperature or humidity) and the limit.
This motor will start spinning when the temperature or humidity is higher than the limit imposed by the user.
